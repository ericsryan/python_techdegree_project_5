## What I Learned
During the development of this project, I had the opportunity to study and implement Flask, a web framework for Python, and integrate it with SQLAlchemy for database management. Some of the key takeaways from this project include:
- Building a web application with Flask, including routing and view functions.
- Designing and implementing a relational database using SQLAlchemy.
- Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on database records.
- Managing project dependencies and virtual environments.

This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in web development and database management using Python and associated technologies.
